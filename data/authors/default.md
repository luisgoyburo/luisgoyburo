I am a Full Stack developer with years of experience leading both front-end and back-end development, and performing quality assurance. Led teams of 5-10 people across technology, business, design and printing departments.

I am interested in creating applications that can have an impact on their respective markets, aimed at maximus customer satisfaction. Regarding my personal development, I want to delve into cutting-edge technologies, and then contribute to the dissemination and development of Web3.
